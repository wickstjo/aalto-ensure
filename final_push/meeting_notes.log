SAMPLING RATE GIVES LESS NOISY DATA BUT REQUIRES THE EXPERIMENT TO BE 3x LONGER

CAN EACH FOLD USE A DIFFERENT 8H EXPERIMENT?
    WOULD THAT BE INTERESTING?

IM NOT SURE WHETHER ITS A GOOD IDEA TO TRY TO DEVELOP A GENERIC MODEL

    TRAIN ON WORKER 1, 2, 3, VALIDATE ON WORKER 4 AND 5
    THE WORKER NODES HAVE SUCH DIFFERENT PERFORMANCE/ENERGY PROFILES

WERE PLANNING TO UNDERCLOCK EACH MACHINE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY
    THEN RERUN THE EXPERIMENTS
    HARD TO TELL WHAT WILL HAPPEN

CAN THE DATA FROM DIFFERENT MACHINES REALLY BE USED INTERCHANGEABLY?
IN A TELCO ENVIRONMENT, THE ECOSYSTEM WILL CONSIST OF HUNDREDS OF TOTALLY DIFFERENT KINDS OF MACHINES
