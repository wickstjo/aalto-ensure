CLUSTER INFRA
    6 INTEL NUCC MACHINES

        GPU?
        MEMORY?

            GIVE SYNOPSIS OF WHAT NUCS ARE
    BAREMETAL KUBERNETES CLUSTER
        1 MASTER NODE
        5 WORKER NODES
    MULTI-THREADING DISABLED BECAUSE IT MISREPRESENTED (TO KUBERNETES) THE AMOUNT OF CPU RESOURCES WITHIN THE CLUSTER

MONITORING STACK
    KUBERNETES METRICS SERVER
    KEPLER ENERGY METRICS
        NODE (MACHINE) LEVEL METRICS
        POD LEVEL METRICS
        CONTAINER LEVEL METRICS
        PROCESS LEVEL METRICS
        HARDWARE COUNTERS
            MEMORY
            CPU
            GPU
    PROMETHETUS FOR SCRAPING ALL ENDPOINTS AT STEADY INTERVAL
    GRAFANA FOR VISUALING SCRAPED METRICS IN NEAR-REAL TIME
    MANUALLY EXTRACT AND EXPORT ALL METRICS FROM PROMETHEUS BETWEEN EXPERIMENTS
    
    ROUGHLY 1300 UNIQUE PRIMARY METRICS
    HOWEVER EACH METRIC CAN HAVE NUMEROUS SUBMETRICS
    FOR EXAMPLE, HAVING ENTRIES FROM EACH UNIQUE CLUSTER NODE, POD OR CONTAINER  
    THE RESULING AMPLIFICATION PRODUCES ROUGHLY 72K UNIQUE SUBMETRICS
        THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE ENTIRELY OR LARGELY STATIC
        ROUGHLY 1K WERE LOSELY DETERMINED TO BE WORTHY OF FURTHER ANALYSIS
    BY TOGGLING ON MORE KEPLER OPTIONS, THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE SUBMETRICS WOULD BE ASTRONOMICALLY HIGHER

WORKLOAD
    FEED DATA INTO KAFKA AT A DYNAMIC RATE
        FOLLOWS A 24H DAY-NIGHT TRAFFIC CYCLE
        OSCILLATION PEAKS AT 80% AT 08:00 AND 95% at 17:00
        AS PRESENTED IN FIGURE X
    
    THE INITIAL DAY-NIGHT CYCLE IS STRETCHED TO THE DESIRED EXPERIMENT DURATION
        WITH LINEAR SPACING AND INTERPOLATION
        THE INTENDED RATIO OF PEAKS AND VALLEYS IS MAINTAINED
    THE STRETCHED DAY-NIGHT CYCLE IS SPLIT INTO n CONSEQUTIVE SEGMENTS
        EACH SEGMENT IS ASSIGNED ITS OWN INPUT RATE PERCENTAGE BASED ON THE DAY-NIGHT CYCLE
    THE MORE SEGMENTS THERE ARE, THE SMOOTHER THE INPUT INTERVAL CHANGES
    FOR EXAMPLE
        A 4H CYCLE IS STRETCHED TO 28800 SECONDS (8H), WHICH IS SPLIT INTO 800 SEGMENTS
        THUS, THE RATE AT WHICH THE CLUSTER IS FED CHANGES EVERY 36 SECONDS
    DEPENDING ON THE CLUSTER CONFIGURATION, THE MB/s REPRESENTATION OF WHAT 100% THROUGHPUT IS SET MANUALLY

    EVERY DATA ENTRY IS REPRESENTED BY A NUMERIC IMAGE MATRIX CONSISTING OF 5.2 KB ON AVERAGE
    A YOLO MODEL, WITHIN A KUBERNETES POD, INTERCEPTS THESE MATRICIES FROM A KAFKA QUEUE AND ANALYZES THE IMAGE FOR OBJECTS
    EVERY YOLO POD IS PART OF THE SAME KAFKA CONSUMER GROUP, WHICH GUARANTEES THAT EACH POD IS ASSIGNED AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF IMAGES TO PROCESS
        THIS FEATURE IS IMPERATIVE FOR WORKING WITH KUBERNETES, WHERE THE NUMBER OF PODS CAN FLUCTUATE GREATLY

    BY USING THE AVERAGE MATRIX BYTECOUNT AND THE CURRENT SEGMENTS' INPUT RATE
        A SCRIPT DETERMINES HOW MANY MATRICIES IT NEEDS TO PUSH INTO KAFKA, AS WELL AS HOW LONG TO IDLE BETWEEN THEM TO SATISFY THE SEGMENT QUOTA
        WE REFER TO THIS AS THE 'ACTION COOLDOWN'
    FOR ADDED REALISM AND VARIANS, EACH ENTRY WITHIN A SEGMENT HAS A UNIQUELY GENERATED +-10% BASELINE COOLDOWN AMPLIFICATION
