KEPLER NOTES
    STILL IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
        REQUIRES SPECIFIC LINUX KERNEL VERSIONS
            FAILED WITH CENTOS LINUX
            SUCCEEDED WITH UBUNTU LINUX
        SOURCE FILES FROM REPO
            GENERATE KUBERNETES DEPLOYMENT FILES VIA SCRIPT
            TRIVIAL TO DEPLOY ONTO KUBERNETES

    SPECIFY DETAILS IN DEPLOYMENT YAML
        EXISTING PROMETHEUS ENDPOINT
        SAMPLING RATE
            DEFAULTS TO RELATIVELY LONG RATE (30s)
            CAN BE SET TO 3s, BUT THE DATA IS VERY NOISY
        WHAT SCRAPING MODULES TO LOAD
            COARSE MODULES
                CPU
                GPU
                MEMORY
                PODS
            GRANULAR MODULES
                CONTAINERS
                PROCESSES
                HARDWARE COUNTS
        MORE METRICS THAN JUST JOULES USED
        ALSO VARIABLES THAT KEPLERS OWN MODEL SERVER USES TO PREDICT ENERGY USAGE

    AUTOMATICALLY INFECTS NEW KUBERNETES CLUSTER NODES WITH KEPLER MONITORS
        EACH NODE TRACKS THE ENERGY USAGE OF CONTAINERS AND PROCESSES
        EACH KEPLER MONITOR IS SCRAPED BY AN EXISTING PROMETHEUS ENDPOINT
        THE SCRAPED DATA CAN BE VISUALIZED THROUGH A GRAFANA DASHBOARD IN NEAR-REAL TIME
    
    FOR CLUSTER OF CLUSTERS SCALE
        MANY PROMETHEUS INSTANCES CAN BE COMBINED AND AGGREGATED WITH THANOS
